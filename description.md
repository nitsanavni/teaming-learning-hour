    -   Can you elaborate?
    -   What do you mean by that?
    -   Can you give an example?

## Concept

### All the Brilliant Minds

Mob Programming, Ensemble Programming, Software Teaming

> "All the brilliant minds working together on the same thing, at the same time, in the same space, and at the same computer"

### Why would we work this way?

> Why would we work this way?

### Mindset

Learn from each other
Help each other

### Strong-style

Two main roles - Typing, Talking

## Concrete - 30m

Introduce the following, one(?) rotation at a time:

1. Call-outs - 4m
   Typist: "I'm John ðŸŽ™, and I'm typing."
   Talker: "I'm Paul, and I'm talking."
   Next: "I'm George ðŸŽ¸, and I'm next."
   Explain and demo - 2m
   Rotation - 2m

2. explain 4m + (2m rotation x 6) = 16m
   Typist: "I'm listening"
   Talker: "My intention is..."

3. Typist: English First
   Talker: "Yes and..."
